							Its difficult for architects to communicate their ideas with their clients.
							For my final year project, my team was assigned with coming up with a VR solution
							that will allow easier and faster communication between architects and their clients.

						<p>
							To better understand the scope of the problem, we applied design thinking
							and conducted extensive user analysis. Having a team with students from both architecture
							and computer science background allowed us to tackle the problem from multiple perspectives.

							We ended up developing a virtual reality app for the Samsung Gear VR using Unity3D.

							I worked in a team of 5 to develop a android game using the unity3D framework.

							is piloting a shuttle in third person view and going through a vortex avoiding obstacles
							and enemies. Basic features allowed the player to pick up powers during his run which changed
							his shuttle. Each shuttle had different powers that assisted the player to navigate around.
							The player could change between two platforms during gameplay. Each platform provided its own challenges.
							The game design was inspired by Starcraft by Blizzard studios and the game mechanics included
							using the phone's built-in gyroscope and accelerometer to give a more immersive and fun gameplay.

							I was responsible for:
