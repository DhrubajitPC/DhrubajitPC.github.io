				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p>I am senior CS student in Singapore University of Technology and Design with a keen interest in learning new skills and meeting new people. Being a CS student, I have also developed a considerable liking for programming and enjoy working on cool and interesting projects.</p>
				<p> I am a shy extrovert and outgoing person who likes travelling and interacting with people from different places. I enjoy listening to music and have picked up the guitar as a hobby hoping against hope to become a rockstar some day when I wake up. In the meantime, I have equipped myself with the magical ability of making games to give people joy. Alright, let's not lie, I enjoy making games for myself more than the noble purpose of sharing joy. </p>

				<p> Below I have shared some of my game projects you might like: </p>
